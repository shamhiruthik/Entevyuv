# Project Overview:

Crop production in India is one of the most important sources of income and India is one of the top countries to produce crops. As per this project, we've analyzed some important visualization, created a dashboard with given datasets, and obtained most of the insights into Crop production in India. And finally embedded the dashboard into the web application we've developed.

# Abstract :

Agriculture is important for human survival because it serves basic needs. A well-known fact is that the majority of the population (≥55%) in India is into agriculture. Due to variations in climatic conditions, there exist bottlenecks for increasing crop production in India. It has become a challenging task to achieve desired targets in Agri based crop yield. Various factors are to be considered which have a direct impact on the production, and productivity of the crops. Crop yield prediction is one of the important factors in agriculture practices. Farmers need information regarding crop yield before sowing seeds in their fields to achieve enhanced crop yield. The use of technology in agriculture has increased in recent years and data analytics is one such trend that has penetrated into the agriculture field. The main challenge in using big data in agriculture is the identification of the effectiveness of big data analytics. Efforts are going on to understand how big data analytics can agriculture productivity. The present study gives insights into various data analytics methods applied to crop yield prediction and also signifies the important lacunae points’ in the proposed area of research.
